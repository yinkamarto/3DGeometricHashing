# 3DGeometricHashing
This R based project is an algorithms in Bioinformatics projects which helps with geometric hashing.

Any 3 dimensional object of any form is rotated by all possible basis and placed in a hash table during the preprocessing phase. The 
recognition phase takes an object, rotates it by any random basis pair and tries to identify if it matches any bin in the hash table. It 
takes a random bin which the new object falls in and does a further calculation to see if there is an actual match.
It is best to use the R studio for proper viewing and debugging of code.
